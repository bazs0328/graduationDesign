Linear algebra studies vectors, matrices, and linear transformations.
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. The determinant can indicate whether a matrix is invertible.
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors reveal important properties of linear transformations.
Probability theory models random events and uncertainty. Conditional probability and Bayes' theorem are core ideas.
